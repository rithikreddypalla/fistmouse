FistMouse
=========

FistMouse lets you control your mouse pointer using your fist, detected via your webcam and OpenCV. If you bring your fist close to the camera, it triggers a mouse click.

## Features
- Move the mouse pointer by moving your fist in front of the camera
- Click by bringing your fist close to the camera

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
	- `pip install opencv-python mouse`
2. Download or train a Haar cascade for fist detection (e.g., `fist.xml`)
3. Set the correct path to your Haar cascade in the script
4. Adjust the focal length and screen size in the script for your setup
5. Run the script: `python fistmouse.py`

## Usage
- Move your fist in front of the webcam to move the mouse pointer
- Bring your fist close to the camera to click
- Press ESC to exit

## Improvements & Notes
- The detection and control are basic and may need calibration for your environment
- For best results, use in good lighting and with a clear background
- Security: No sensitive data is stored, but always be careful with webcam access

## Author's Note
This is a fun computer vision experiment. The code is a bit clumsy and can be improved with better detection, smoothing, and calibration.
